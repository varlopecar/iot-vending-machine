# Global rule

Our project is a connected vending machine platform that enables users to reserve up to two products from a machine via their smartphone (web or mobile), then retrieve them by scanning a unique QR code. The system integrates a loyalty program, a real-time stock tracking mechanism, and an admin back-office for operations management.

We use a Turborepo monorepo with three main applications: a React Native mobile app (Expo), a Next.js web interface, and a NestJS backend. All API communication is handled through tRPC, ensuring end-to-end type safety across the stack. Our data is stored in a PostgreSQL relational database.

The system must:

- Decrement stock immediately when a reservation is placed (not when it is picked up),
- Invalidate expired or already-used QR codes,
- Log loyalty point operations for each user, tracked via a personal barcode,
- Allow users to consult their loyalty history and redeem rewards,
- Offer a modern, fluid and accessible UI experience across platforms.

We prioritize accessibility and animation fluidity, and expect all interfaces to meet WCAG standards while still feeling delightful to use.
