# Mobile

The mobile app is developed using React Native with Expo. Its core purpose is to allow users to log in, view machines nearby, select products (1â€“2 max), and place a reservation. A secure QR code is then displayed, allowing them to retrieve their items at the vending machine.

The app communicates with the backend exclusively via tRPC to ensure type safety. We use React Navigation for routing and Reanimated for smooth, native-like transitions and animations.

Accessibility is a top priority: all components should support screen readers, motion-reduce settings, and large text modes. Animations should feel modern and elegant without being distracting.

The app also includes a loyalty dashboard, allowing users to monitor their points, see their barcode, and consult their order history.
