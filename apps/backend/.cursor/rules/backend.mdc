# Backend

The backend is built in NestJS and uses tRPC to expose typed APIs to both the web and mobile front-ends. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store. Prisma is used as the ORM.

The backend manages:

- Users, products, machines, and real-time stocks,
- Orders (linked to up to 2 products),
- QR code token generation (UUID or secure hash),
- Loyalty point calculation and logging,
- Admin logs and expired command handling.

When a user places an order, stock is decremented immediately. If the order is not picked up before `expires_at`, it is marked as expired and the stock is restored. QR code tokens are single-use only, and validated server-side with status and expiry checks.

Admins can monitor operations via the activity_logs table and consult all data from a back-office interface. All endpoints must be secured and tested thoroughly.

## Zod Schema Best Practices

When working with Zod schemas, use the modern syntax to avoid deprecation warnings:

- Use `z.uuid()` instead of `z.string().uuid()`
- Use `z.email()` instead of `z.string().email()`
- Use `z.url()` instead of `z.string().url()`
- Use `z.date()` instead of `z.string().datetime()`

This prevents the deprecated string method warnings and follows current Zod best practices.
