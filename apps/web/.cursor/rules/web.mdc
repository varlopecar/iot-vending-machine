# Back-office

The web app is the back-office interface of the connected vending machine project. Built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS, it is used by admins to monitor and manage operations across all machines.

Admins can:

- View and manage all products, machines, and stock levels,
- Monitor incoming and expired orders,
- Track which products are reserved, picked up, or expired,
- Access user and loyalty point data,
- View and filter detailed activity logs.

All data is fetched via tRPC with strict end-to-end type safety. The interface must be responsive, fast, and easy to use, even for non-technical staff.

Framer Motion is used to enhance usability with smooth transitions and subtle animations. All animations must respect motion-reduce preferences and accessibility standards (focus outlines, keyboard navigation, color contrast).

Security is enforced at the route level, ensuring only authenticated admin users can access this app.
